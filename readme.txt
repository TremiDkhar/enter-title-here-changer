Replace the default `Add Title` (Gutenberg) or `Enter title here` (Legacy) placeholder when creating a new post.

== Description ==
Using this plugin helps you to change the default placeholder in the title field when creating a new post. This is helpful, especially when using a Custom Post Type. For example, for a `movie` Custom Post Type, instead of default `Add title` placeholder, it can be changed to `Enter Movie Title` or to anything that make more sense.

## Why you need to replace the title placeholder text?
By replacing the placeholder text when creating a new post, help to instruct users to what the title should be.

This plugin is inspired by an article at [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-replace-enter-title-here-text-in-wordpress/).
